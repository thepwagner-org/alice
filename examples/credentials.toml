# Example configuration demonstrating credential injection.
#
# Alice replaces "dummy" tokens with real secrets loaded from env vars or files.
# This allows Bob (the client) to use placeholder tokens that get replaced
# before requests reach upstream.
#
# Test with:
#   REAL_TOKEN=secret123 cargo run -- -c examples/credentials.toml
#   curl --proxy http://localhost:3128 --cacert /tmp/alice-ca.pem \
#        -H "Authorization: Bearer DUMMY_TOKEN" \
#        https://httpbin.org/headers
#
# Using SOPS for encrypted secrets:
#
#   # Create a secrets file (secrets.env)
#   export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxx
#   export API_KEY=sk-xxxx
#
#   # Encrypt with SOPS (supports age, PGP, AWS KMS, etc.)
#   sops -e -i secrets.env
#
#   # Run Alice with decrypted env vars
#   sops exec-env secrets.env -- alice -c config.toml
#
# This approach works with any SOPS backend, including hardware tokens
# via age-plugin-yubikey.

# Credential injection: replace dummy tokens with real secrets
#
# Each credential specifies:
#   - name: identifier for logging
#   - host: glob pattern for which hosts to inject (e.g., "*.github.com")
#   - header: which HTTP header to check/replace
#   - match: the dummy value that triggers replacement
#   - format: how to format the real value (use {value} placeholder)
#   - env: environment variable containing the real secret
#   - file: file path containing the real secret (alternative to env)
